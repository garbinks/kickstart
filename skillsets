I'm fairly seasoned in the realm of testing--unit vs functional, black box vs white box. 
I'd like to think I have a good sense of project design, though I've never had any formal architecture training. 
I think object oriented paradigm (OOP) lends itself to simplifying designs, but we shouldn't limit ourselves to OOP. 
Simple designs are maintainable and stable. 
If your design is simple, it is very easy to spot misuse of a component and realize design limitations/flaws.
For ex: Hey guys, we definitely need a new component to do XYZ, since it is clearly not covered by our existing components.
It creates a clear direction of where to take the design.
